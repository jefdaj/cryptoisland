Welcome to <b>Crypto Island</b>!

It's your standard programmer blog, but I'll attempt to keep it fun by rambling
less and illustrating everything with boats, pirates and the like.

Note: totally unrelated to [any][ci2] of [these][ci3] [other][ci4] [crypto][ci5] [islands][ci6].
I hope you'll associate this one with tutorials, open source code, and the occasional relatively sober utopian idea that isn't uncomfortably colonial or an obvious cash grab.

I go by *jefdaj* online. Here are some ways you can contact me:

- Email (same handle at `protonmail.ch` or `berkeley.edu`)

<!-- TODO bitmessage? -->

Encrypted emails aren't required of course, but I like them!
[Here][pubkey] is my public key.
You can also look it up on [keys.openpgp.org][openpgp] or import it directly with `gpg`:

~~~{ .bash }
gpg --keyserver keys.openpgp.org \
  --recv-key 54C195A345205DCABC2010EEE604517174B3D49E
~~~

See [this post][post] for help generating your own keys if needed.
