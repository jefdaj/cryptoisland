Welcome to <b>Crypto Island</b>!

It's your standard programmer blog, but I'll try to keep it fun by rambling
less and illustrating everything with boats, pirates and the like.

I go by *jefdaj* online. Here are some ways you can contact me:

- Email (same handle at `protonmail.ch` or `berkeley.edu`)
- [Github](https://github.com/jefdaj)
* [StackExchange](https://stackoverflow.com/users/429898/jefdaj)
* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/jefdaj)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jefdaj)
- Secure Scuttlebutt
- Meetup
<!-- TODO bitmessage? -->

Encrypted emails go to the top of the list! [Here][pubkey] is my public key.
You can also look it up on [keys.openpgp.org][openpgp] or import it directly into `gpg`:

~~~{ .bash }
gpg --keyserver keys.openpgp.org --recv-key 54C195A345205DCABC2010EEE604517174B3D49E
~~~

(And see [this post][post] for help generating your own keys if needed)
